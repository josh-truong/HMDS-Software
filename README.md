# HMDS-Software

The Helmet-Mounted Display System (HDMS) utilizes advanced software powered by Google ARCore SDK for enhanced situational awareness and operational capabilities.

The HDMS software was influenced by the F-35 Gen III HDMS, with the goal of replicating specific features for FPV drone racing. However, it may also include other assistive technologies for environments like space. The software was created in response to NASA's SUITS Design Challenge, which focuses on developing HUDs for future spacesuits intended for use on the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
