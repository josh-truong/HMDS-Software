# HMDS-Helmet-Software

The helmet-mounted display utilizes advanced software powered by Google ARCore SDK for enhanced situational awareness and operational capabilities.

The helmet-mounted display software was initially influenced by the F-35 Gen III HDMS, with the goal of replicating certain features for use in First Person View (FPV) drone racing. However, the software may also incorporate other assistive technologies for extreme environments, such as spaceflight. This project is a personal response to NASA's SUITS Design Challenge, which focuses on developing Heads Up Displays (HUDs) for future spacesuits intended for use on the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
